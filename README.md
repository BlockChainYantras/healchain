Problem: 
Basic health information of a person such as Blood group, heart/diabetic problem info, order donor status are quickly needed when a person is fainted / met in accident. Delay in finding these info may cost a life. In emergency need of initial funds is crucial. 

Solution:
Using hyperledger blockchain, We store a person's both public health information 
& private medical history. We allow hospitals/labs to issue blood donor rebates as ERC20 based HEAL Tokens. And they will accept HEAL tokens as mode of payment.
